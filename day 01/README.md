## **What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?**

AI-Driven Development simply means to me that the future belongs to AI agents. Development is no longer about learning and writing syntax; instead, developers will act as orchestrators and architects who think about *what* to build. They will document all information in a specification file, which will later be used by AI agents — the real coders.

These agents will read the specification file and write code, test, debug, and build systems for you. Developers will maintain full control, validating whether the AI-generated output works correctly instead of manually writing code. With this shift, complex applications that once required months to build can be completed within weeks or even days, increasing productivity by nearly 100x. This is the future of development, and this is what AI-Driven Development means to me.

## **How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?**

The era of AI agents is one of the biggest innovations in human history, transforming every field — including software development. With Human–AI collaboration, companies no longer need large engineering teams to build a single product. Instead, solo developers or small teams working with AI partners can build complex software in just weeks.

AI agents have changed everything. Developers are now thinkers, planners, and system designers who focus on designing architectures, planning features, and clearly communicating everything to AI agents through specification files. The AI agent then builds, tests, and deploys the application.

This new era significantly reduces development costs, accelerates timelines from months to weeks or days, and greatly increases productivity. AI is not replacing humans — it is empowering them. Humans and AI agents will complement each other.
